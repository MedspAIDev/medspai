      <h1 class="blog-title">How One Med Spa Booked $23,280 in 60 Days Without Spending a Dime on Ads</h1>

      <p class="blog-intro">
        Peak Health & Aesthetics, a busy med spa in Cypress, Texas, became the first clinic to test our custom-built AI assistant. The early results sparked the launch of MedspAI.
      </p>

      <p>
        Harrison, Co-Founder of MedspAI, was running the business side of Peak Health & Aesthetics when he started exploring ways to reduce lost leads through AI. After studying automation in service-based businesses, he built a custom agent for Peak and rolled it out on their website.
      </p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        Like many growing med spas, Peak Health & Aesthetics had a common challenge. Inquiries were coming in after hours, staff were stretched thin, and follow-up often took too long. This led to missed opportunities and lost revenue.
      </p>

      <h2>The Challenge</h2>
      <p>
        Peak was not running paid ads. All leads were organic, mostly from Google searches and social referrals. Even with steady traffic, too many prospects never made it to the calendar because no one followed up in time.
      </p>

      <h2>The Solution</h2>
      <p>
        Harrison built a fully customized AI assistant for Peak. It responded to inquiries instantly, answered common treatment questions, qualified leads, and booked consultations directly into their calendar. The assistant worked 24/7, including after hours when most conversions were being lost.
      </p>

      <h2>Results After 60 Days</h2>
      <ul style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.8; max-width: 700px; margin: 0 auto;">
        <li>📈 6 new patients booked</li>
        <li>💰 $3,000 in immediate revenue</li>
        <li>📊 $23,280 in projected lifetime value (LTV)</li>
        <li>✅ 78% lead-to-booking conversion rate</li>
        <li>🚫 $0 spent on advertising</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Key Takeaway</h2>
      <p>
        Peak's story shows how small med spas can achieve real revenue growth through smart automation. With the right assistant in place, lead follow-up becomes instant, reliable, and scalable. These results helped shape the vision for what would become MedspAI.
