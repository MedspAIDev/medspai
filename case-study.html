      <h1 class="blog-title">How One Med Spa Booked $23,280 in 60 Days... Without Spending a Dime on Ads</h1>

      <p class="blog-intro">
        Peak Health & Aesthetics, a busy med spa in Cypress, Texas, became the first clinic to test our custom-built AI assistant, and the early results sparked the birth of MedspAI.
      </p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        Like many growing med spas, Peak Health & Aesthetics faced a common bottleneck: inquiries were coming in after hours, staff were stretched thin, and lead follow-up often lagged by hours — sometimes days. These gaps cost the business missed opportunities and lost revenue.
      </p>

      <h2>The Challenge</h2>
      <p>
        Peak wasn’t running paid ads — all leads were organic. But even with a steady stream of interest, too many leads were slipping through the cracks. There was no system in place to instantly answer questions, qualify prospects, or convert them into booked patients.
      </p>

      <h2>The Solution</h2>
      <p>
        We deployed a fully customized AI assistant on their website. It instantly responded to inquiries, collected lead info, answered questions about treatments, and, most importantly, booked consultations directly into the clinic’s calendar.
      </p>

      <h2>Results After 60 Days</h2>
      <ul style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.8; max-width: 700px; margin: 0 auto;">
        <li>📈 6 new patients booked</li>
        <li>💰 $3,000 in immediate revenue</li>
        <li>📊 $23,280 in projected lifetime value (LTV)</li>
        <li>✅ 78% lead-to-booking conversion rate</li>
        <li>🚫 $0 spent on advertising</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What This Proves</h2>
      <p>
        Peak’s story demonstrates that AI can quietly, effectively drive real revenue — even in a small, locally-run practice. The assistant didn’t just respond quickly, it became a consistent booking engine.
      </p>

      <p>
        These early results are what inspired us to launch MedspAI: an AI assistant purpose-built for med spas that want to grow without increasing staff load or ad spend.
